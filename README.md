<p align="center">Move messages between channels, and even between Discord servers.</p>

Simple bot to clone messages from one Discord server/channel to another. It has one slash command, `/clone`, which takes 2/3 arguments: source channel ID, destination channel ID, and the source guild ID (if cloning from external server).

To clone messages from another server, the bot has to be invited into both servers.
